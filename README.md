# Cloudflare Booth Puzzle System

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Vibe Coding Experiment Disclaimer**  
> This project is a vibe coding experiment - built for fun, exploration, and learning. The code, architecture, documentation (including this README), and features were developed in an experimental, iterative manner. While functional, this should be considered a proof-of-concept rather than production-ready enterprise software. Use at your own discretion! üöÄ

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with modern responsive design
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers with KV storage
- **Puzzle Logic**: Hardcoded algorithm generating valid number sequence puzzles
- **Storage**: Cloudflare KV for conferences, submissions, and state management

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Cloudflare account with Workers enabled
- Wrangler CLI installed (`npm install -g wrangler`)

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd cloudflare-booth-puzzle
npm install -g wrangler
```

### 2. Configure Cloudflare KV
```bash
# Create KV namespace for production
wrangler kv:namespace create "PUZZLE_KV"

# Create KV namespace for preview/development
wrangler kv:namespace create "PUZZLE_KV" --preview
```

### 3. Update wrangler.toml
Replace the KV namespace IDs in `wrangler.toml` with your actual namespace IDs:

```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "PUZZLE_KV"
id = "your_production_kv_namespace_id"
preview_id = "your_preview_kv_namespace_id"
```

### 4. Deploy
```bash
# Deploy to production
wrangler deploy

# Or deploy to preview
wrangler dev
```

## Usage Guide

### For Conference Setup
1. Access the admin interface at `https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/admin`
2. Create a new conference with a descriptive name
3. Note the conference ID generated
4. Display the puzzle on your booth monitor: `https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/puzzle?conference=your-conference-id`

### For Attendees
1. Scan the QR code displayed on the puzzle screen
2. Enter the 3-digit solution
3. Provide name and email for raffle entry
4. Submit and receive confirmation

### For Prize Drawing
1. In the admin interface, click "Spin the Wheel!" to automatically switch the display to winner mode
2. The puzzle display will auto-refresh and show the spinning wheel (within 3 seconds)
3. Click "SPIN THE WHEEL!" to randomly select a winner
4. Click "END CONTEST & SAVE WINNER" to finalize and save the winner
5. The display will show the final winner announcement (no redirect to admin)

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /` - Puzzle display (default conference)
- `GET /puzzle?conference=ID` - Puzzle display for specific conference
- `GET /submit?conference=ID` - Submission form for specific conference
- `GET /winner?conference=ID` - Winner wheel for specific conference

### Admin Endpoints
- `GET /admin` - Admin interface
- `GET /api/conferences` - List all conferences
- `POST /api/conferences` - Create new conference
- `POST /api/conferences/{id}/reshuffle` - Generate new puzzle
- `POST /api/conferences/{id}/finish` - End contest
- `POST /api/conferences/{id}/switch-to-winner` - Switch display to winner wheel
- `POST /api/conferences/{id}/switch-to-puzzle` - Switch display back to puzzle
- `GET /api/conferences/{id}/display-mode` - Get current display mode
- `POST /api/submit` - Submit puzzle answer (with Turnstile)
- `POST /api/test-submit` - Submit puzzle answer (bypass Turnstile for testing)

## Puzzle Logic

The system generates number sequence puzzles with exactly **5 clues** of the following types:
1. **One number is correct but wrongly placed**: One digit from the solution appears in the clue but in the wrong position
2. **One number is correct but wrongly placed**: Another digit from the solution appears in the clue but in the wrong position  
3. **Two numbers are correct and well placed**: Two digits from the solution appear in their correct positions
4. **Two numbers are correct but wrongly placed**: Two digits from the solution appear in the clue but both are in wrong positions
5. **Nothing is correct**: None of the digits in this clue appear in the solution

Each puzzle has a unique 3-digit solution with no repeated digits that can be determined by analyzing all 5 clues together.

## Data Storage

### Conference Data Structure
```json
{
  "id": "conference-id",
  "name": "Conference Name",
  "puzzle": {
    "solution": [1, 2, 3],
    "clues": [
      {
        "numbers": [5, 7, 9],
        "hint": "All are correct but only one is placed correctly"
      }
    ]
  },
  "active": true,
  "created": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Submission Data Structure
```json
{
  "id": "submission-uuid",
  "conferenceId": "conference-id",
  "answer": [1, 2, 3],
  "name": "Attendee Name",
  "email": "attendee@example.com",
  "correct": true,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Security Considerations

- No authentication required for puzzle viewing (public display)
- Admin interface has no built-in authentication (add Cloudflare Access if needed)
- All submissions are stored with timestamps for audit trails
- CORS enabled for API endpoints
- Input validation on all form submissions

## Customization

### Styling
- Modify CSS variables in the HTML templates to match your branding
- Update colors, fonts, and layout in the embedded styles
- Replace Cloudflare logo and branding as needed

### Puzzle Generation
- Modify the `generatePuzzle()` function to change puzzle complexity
- Add new clue types or modify existing hint text
- Integrate with Workers AI for dynamic puzzle generation

### Features
- Add email notifications for winners
- Integrate with external CRM systems
- Add analytics and reporting
- Implement multi-language support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **KV Namespace Errors**: Ensure KV namespace IDs are correctly configured
2. **CORS Issues**: Check that CORS headers are properly set for your domain
3. **QR Code Not Loading**: Verify the QR code library CDN is accessible
4. **Puzzle Not Generating**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Debugging
- Use `wrangler tail` to view real-time logs
- Check the Cloudflare dashboard for error rates and performance metrics
- Use browser developer tools to debug frontend issues
